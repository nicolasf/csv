# üóÇ CSV Ô∏è

This tiny library was written for one of my projects, and then shared with awesome Kotlin community. 

# Usage

There is no documentation for the API which consists of just three methods:
```kotlin

// 1. Build CSV using mico DSL
val csv = buildCsv {
    row { value("Code"); value("Name") }
    row { value("DE"); value("Germany") }
}

// 2. Export CSV object to CSV text
val csvText = csv.toCsvText()

// 3. Parse CSV text into a CSV object
val csv2 = parseCsv(csvText)

csv == csv2 // true
```

Feel free to open PRs for features you miss, please remember though keeping API minimalistic, predictable and self-explanatory.

# Dependencies

In gradle/libs.versions.toml
```toml
[versions]
csv = "0.3"

[libraries]
csv = { module = "de.halfbit:csv", version.ref = "csv" }
```

    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.csv)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
