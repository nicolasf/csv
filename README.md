# üóÇ CSV Ô∏è

This is a micro library I wrote for one of my projects and then decided to share with awesome Kotlin community. 


It can **parse**, **build** and **generate** CSV text. There is no documentation because the API is expected to be predictable and self-explanatory. Feel free to add a PR if you miss anything.

# Usage

In gradle/libs.versions.toml
```toml
[versions]
csv = "0.2"

[libraries]
csv = { module = "de.halfbit:csv", version.ref = "csv" }
```

In shared/build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.csv)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
