# üóÇ CSV Ô∏è

This tiny library was written for one of my projects, and then shared with awesome Kotlin community. 

# Usage

There is no documentation for the API which consists of just three methods:
- `parseCsv(csvText: String): Csv`
- `buildCsv { row { value("code") } } : Csv`
- and `Csv.toCsvText(): String`


Feel free to open PRs for features you miss, please remember though keeping API minimalistic, predictable and self-explanatory.

# Dependencies

In gradle/libs.versions.toml
```toml
[versions]
csv = "0.5"

[libraries]
csv = { module = "de.halfbit:csv", version.ref = "csv" }
```

In shared/build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val commonMain by getting {
            dependencies {
                implementation(libs.csv)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
