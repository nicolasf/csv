# üóÇ CSV Ô∏è

This tiny library was written for one of my projects, and then shared with awesome Kotlin community. 

# Usage

There is no documentation for the API which consists of just three methods:
```kotlin

// Build CSV object using simple DSL
val csv = buildCsv {
    row {
        value("Code")
        value("Name")
    }
    row {
        value("DE")
        value("Germany")
    }
}

// Export CSV object to CSV text
val csvText = csv.toCsvText()

// Parse CSV text to get a CSV object
val csv2 = parseCsv(csvText)

// Compare created and parsed objects
csv == csv2 // true
```

Feel free to open PRs for features you miss, please remember keeping API minimalistic, predictable and self-explanatory.
